# Bluecard

Bluecard is a a prototype ID scanning system.

It's designed to replace manual workflows, where a clerk is handed a license, and hand-types information contained on it.

Instead, the document is scanned, or photograph, uploaded into the system, and using OCR, relevant data is extracted.

### Note: this is sub-alpha.  It is not ready for production use, and probably needs to be radically re-designed to operate in a production environment.

This project was created to:

1. Learn [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
2. Explore Amazon [AWS's Lambda processing framework](http://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)
3. Experiment with the [Captricity](http://captricity.com) document processing API
